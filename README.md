# Inerital-Navigation-System
Attitude reference system using IMU + GPS data.
Extract #4 from the MÃ¡laga Stereo and Laser Urban Data Set (http://www.mrpt.org/MalagaUrbanDataset#33_Binary_files) has been used.

GPS data has been used to increase accuracy of the extended Kalman filter estimates for heading. IMU data is used to obtain higher bandwidth.

Run main_INS.m to obtain the results.
